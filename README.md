Prediction model for 2016 US presidential election with Python

In this project, using the data of past two presidential elections in US (2008 and 2012), a linear model is developed to predict the 
results of 2016 election. 
Different features of the each county and state such as race, age, education, and income are used to predict which party 
(democrat or republican) each state would vote for. 
At the end, using the formula for Electoral College, the model would announce the winner for the white house.
